<h1 id="Markdown"><a href="#Markdown" class="headerlink" title="Markdown"></a>Markdown</h1><p>You just have to love the simplicity of <strong>markdown</strong>, it doens’t<br>provide a lot of fancy features that <em>reStructured Text</em> or <em>Textile</em><br>do, but in return, you get a wonderfully straightforward way to create<br>formatted documents, with almost zero overhead.</p>
<p>It seems to me that technical authors probably have the most to gain<br>from using <strong>markdown</strong>, this is probably why the most popular<br>technical sites on the web use it as their primary text markup<br>language.</p>

<p>Lists are phenomenally easy too … </p>
<ol>
<li>Just number each item with 1.</li>
<li>The markdown implementation of your choice will turn it into a<br>numbered list.</li>
<li><p>Although, I think you will get varying levels of cleverness from<br>different implementations…</p>
<ol>
<li>Nested lists work ok. </li>
<li>But I find as soon as you start to get a bit clever, things tend to go<br>wrong. You won’t have much luck tring to use a combination of code<br>blocks or blockquotes</li>

<li>But then what about resuming the list, nah, I don’t think so.</li>
